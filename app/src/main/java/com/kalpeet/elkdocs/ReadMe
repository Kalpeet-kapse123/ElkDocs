I have used Jetpack Compose for the UI design which was the assignment given to me and I have used Kotlin for all other work.
The screenShots and video of my work are also shared on the same github repository.
You must run the app on a API level 34 or above mobile and use dark mode to get best experience.
I have also shared the work in Dark mode only.
